    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m a beginner front-end developer passionate about building clean and responsive websites.  
      I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and Iâ€™m eager to help clients with small projects such as landing pages, website fixes, and interactive web features.

      Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Obayagbonna Osarhuevbinomwa, and Iâ€™m a beginner front-end developer passionate about building clean and responsive websites.

I specialize in:
<br>

âœ… HTML for creating structured web pages
<br>

âœ… CSS for designing modern, mobile-friendly layouts
<br>

âœ… JavaScript for adding interactivity and functionality
<br>
Iâ€™ve built projects such as a personal portfolio website, a to-do list app, and a calculator app using these technologies. These demonstrate my ability to create simple but useful web applications.
<br>

As I grow my experience, Iâ€™m committed to:
<br>
Delivering work on time
<br>
Writing clean, easy-to-read code
<br>
Communicating clearly with clients
<br>
ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m especially interested in small projects like:
<br>
Fixing HTML/CSS layout issues
<br>
Creating simple landing pages
<br>
Adding interactive features with JavaScript
<br>
Building basic web apps
<br>
I may be new to Upwork, but Iâ€™m eager to learn, grow, and help clients achieve their goals. If youâ€™re looking for a motivated beginner who will give full effort to your project, Iâ€™d love to work with you.
